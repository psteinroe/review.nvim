Ralph is a technique for running AI coding agents in a loop. You run the same prompt repeatedly. The AI picks its own tasks from a PRD. It commits after each feature. You come back later to working code.

This guide walks you through building your first Ralph loop. We'll use Claude Code and Docker Desktop.

I'm assuming Linux, but you can point an AI at this article and have it translate for your OS or AI Coding CLI.

1. Install Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI for agentic coding. Install it with the native binary:


curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
If you get "command not found: claude" after installing, add the install location to your PATH:


echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Alternatively, install via npm:


npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
Run claude to authenticate with your Anthropic account.

2. Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop lets you run Claude Code in an isolated sandbox. The AI can execute commands, install packages, and modify files without touching your local machine.

Install Docker Desktop 4.50+, then run:


docker sandbox run claude
On first run, you'll authenticate with Anthropic. Your credentials are stored in a Docker volume.

Key benefits of sandboxes:

Your working directory mounts at the same path inside the container
Git config is auto-injected for proper commit attribution
One sandbox per workspace - state persists between runs
See the Docker Sandboxes docs for more.

3. Create your Plan File

Ralph needs a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to pick tasks from. You could write one manually, but it's faster to use Claude's plan mode.

Run Claude:


claude
And press shift-tab to enter plan mode. You'll be able to iterate on a plan until you're happy with it.

When you're happy with the plan, tell Claude to save it to PRD.md.

Also create an empty progress file:


touch progress.txt
The PRD defines the end state. The progress file tracks what's done. Claude reads both on each loop iteration, finds the next unchecked item, implements it, and updates progress.

The PRD can be in any format - markdown checklist, JSON, plain prose. What matters is that the scope is clear and the agent can pull out individual tasks. For more tips on writing good PRDs, see my 11 tips for AI coding with Ralph.

4. Create Your ralph-once.sh Script

Before going fully AFK, start with a human-in-the-loop Ralph. You run the script, watch what it does, then run it again. This builds intuition for how the loop works.

Create ralph-once.sh:


#!/bin/bash

claude --permission-mode acceptEdits "@PRD.md @progress.txt \
1. Read the PRD and progress file. \
2. Find the next incomplete task and implement it. \
3. Commit your changes. \
4. Update progress.txt with what you did. \
ONLY DO ONE TASK AT A TIME."
Key elements:

Element	Purpose
--permission-mode acceptEdits	Auto-accepts file edits so the loop doesn't stall
@PRD.md	Points Claude at your requirements doc
@progress.txt	Tracks completed work between runs
ONLY DO ONE TASK	Forces small, incremental commits
Make it executable:


chmod +x ralph-once.sh
Run it with ./ralph-once.sh. Watch what Claude does. Check the commit. Run it again.

5. Create your afk-ralph.sh Script

Once you're comfortable with human-in-the-loop Ralph, wrap it in a loop:


#!/bin/bash
set -e

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <iterations>"
  exit 1
fi

for ((i=1; i<=$1; i++)); do
  result=$(docker sandbox run claude --permission-mode acceptEdits -p "@PRD.md @progress.txt \
  1. Find the highest-priority task and implement it. \
  2. Run your tests and type checks. \
  3. Update the PRD with what was done. \
  4. Append your progress to progress.txt. \
  5. Commit your changes. \
  ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK. \
  If the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.")

  echo "$result"

  if [[ "$result" == *"<promise>COMPLETE</promise>"* ]]; then
    echo "PRD complete after $i iterations."
    exit 0
  fi
done
The -p flag runs Claude in print mode - non-interactive, outputs to stdout. This lets us capture the result and check for the completion sigil.


./afk-ralph.sh 20
Go make coffee. Come back to commits.

Element	Purpose
set -e	Exit on any error
$1 (iterations)	Caps the loop to prevent runaway costs
-p	Print mode - non-interactive output
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>	Completion sigil Claude outputs when done
6. Make It Your Own

Ralph is just a loop. That simplicity makes it infinitely customizable.

You can swap the task source. Instead of a local PRD, pull tasks from GitHub Issues, Linear, or beads. The agent still chooses what to work on - you just change where the list lives.

You can change the output. Instead of committing to main, each iteration could create a branch and open a PR. Useful for triaging a backlog of issues.

You can run different loop types entirely:

Loop Type	What It Does
Test Coverage	Finds uncovered lines, writes tests until coverage hits target
Linting	Fixes lint errors one by one
Duplication	Hooks into jscpd, refactors clones into shared utilities
Entropy	Scans for code smells, cleans them up
Any task that fits "look at repo, improve something, commit" works with Ralph.
